# Level Up Frontend
Welcome to the frontend of your level up assessment! 
This is a React.js web app that uses react-router-dom to simulate page routing.

This is a basic template for you to start off with. We have configured the routing for the pages, added some styling and a couple components but the rest is up to you!

Our designers have already created a design for you to replicate. Everything you will need in this repository, for quick navigation, use the links below:
